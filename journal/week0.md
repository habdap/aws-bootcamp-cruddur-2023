# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

For this week, I did create my AWS Account, I then set up a user on it, which I am now using in place of the root user.
On my AWS account, I created two billing alarms that is subscribed to an SNS topic created with my email.
Created AWS budgets, two budgets, one for zero-spend and the other one for a total estimated cost.
Set up my gitpod and connected it to my gitpod, I then download AWS cli and every other dependencies needed for the project.
Also finished all my homework including the CI/CD architecture
